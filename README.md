PokemonAPI + Async + Axios

Must install Node to use Axios. For this, refer to https://nodejs.org/en/download and install the latest version. After this, refer to your project's folder, open cmd on the directory's search bar and execute the command "npm init -y", and then the command "npm install axios". If it still doesn't work, reboot your PC and open the files once more. 

Once this is done, all node files should be installed within the project and it should be ready to use.
